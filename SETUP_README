setup:
- >> git clone https://github.com/orenmn/qemu_with_GMBEOO
- >> (cd qemu_with_GMBEOO && git submodule init && git submodule update --recursive && git checkout mem_tracer)
- >> git clone https://github.com/orenmn/qemu_mem_tracer
- >> sudo apt-get install python
- Install python3.7. E.g. (according to
  https://askubuntu.com/questions/865554/how-do-i-install-python-3-6-using-apt-get/865569#865569):
    * >> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    * >> sudo apt-get update
    * >> sudo apt-get install python3.7
- Make sure python3.7 runs when you do: >> /usr/bin/env python3.7
- >> sudo add-apt-repository universe
- >> sudo apt-get install expect
- >> sudo apt-get install pkg-config
- >> sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
- >> sudo apt-get install libpixman-1-dev
- >> chmod u+x qemu_mem_tracer/build.py
- >> qemu_mem_tracer/build.py <qemu_with_GMBEOO_path>
- Either ask orenmn@gmail.com for a qemu image for memory_tracer, or create
  one yourself:
    * Download ubuntu-18.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso
       (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server).
    * Create an "empty" image. E.g.:
        ~ >> qemu_with_GMBEOO/qemu-img create -f qcow2 vm_disk.qcow2 25G
          (See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Images#Creating_an_image and
          https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux#Getting_the_source_code)
    * Install the Ubuntu Server on it. E.g.:
        ~ >> qemu_with_GMBEOO/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2560 -hda vm_disk.qcow2 -cdrom ubuntu-18.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso -monitor stdio
            + You can switch between the guest console and qemu monitor using
              Ctrl-a c, and terminate the emulator using Ctrl-a x. See
              https://qemu.weilnetz.de/doc/qemu-doc.html#mux_005fkeys.
            + If you get "cannot set up guest memory 'pc.ram': Cannot
              allocate memory", then 2560MB is too much for your machine to
              give qemu, so specify a smaller amount.
            + Don’t worry about a "spectre v2 mitigation" message at the
              beginning (it didn’t seem to ruin anything for me. The
              startup just moves on).
            + It would probably take some time. An easy way to check
              whether the guest is actually dead (and not just working
              diligently but silently): use the qemu’s monitor command
              `info registers` several times. If the registers change, then
              you should probably just wait.
            + When you are done installing the Ubuntu server,
              close qemu_with_GMBEOO.
    * Start qemu_with_GMBEOO. E.g.:
        ~ >> qemu_with_GMBEOO/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2560 -hda vm_disk.qcow2 -monitor stdio -serial pty
    * I highly recommend giving your qemu guest some time to completely
      finish the startup process (even after logging in, i guess many
      startup scripts are still running). Sounds obvious in retrospect, but
      I didn’t do that at first, and used snapshots that were created right
      after startup. When I started using snapshots that were taken only
      after startup really completed, the speedup was significant.
    * Inside the qemu guest:
        ~ Copy run_executables_from_serial from the host into the guest, and make
          it executable.
          E.g. (inside the guest, 10.0.2.2 is the host):
            + >> scp orenmn@10.0.2.2:qemu_mem_tracer/to_run_on_guest/run_executables_from_serial run_executables_from_serial
            + >> chmod 777 run_executables_from_serial
        ~ >> sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
        ~ >> ./run_executables_from_serial
            + run_executables_from_serial is waiting for input through the serial.
              If it printed "Opened /dev/ttyS0.", proceed to the next step
              without terminating run_executables_from_serial.
        ~ Save an internal snapshot of the guest by executing the `savevm` qemu
          monitor command (monitor commands can be executed through the terminal
          you used to start qemu_with_GMBEOO). E.g.:
            + >> savevm ready_for_memory_tracer
        ~ Close qemu_with_GMBEOO.
- >> qemu_mem_tracer/build.py <qemu_with_GMBEOO_path> --dont_compile_qemu --run_tests --guest_image_path <GUEST_IMAGE_PATH> --snapshot_name <SNAPSHOT_NAME>
